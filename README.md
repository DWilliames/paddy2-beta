# Paddy 2 â€“ Beta

I've began completely rewriting the [Paddy Sketch plugin](https://github.com/DWilliames/paddy-sketch-plugin) in a way that means I can do a lot more with it.

I have a lot planned for what I want to do with this next version; one of the key things is to make it a lot more stable.

Treat this as the **'Beta program'** for Paddy. If you are up for it; play around with it, and let me know what is working and what isn't.

As you can see via the 'Todo list', not everything has been implemented yet â€“ so bare with me, as I slowly implement it all. I'm trying to lock down the core things now (Padding / Spacing / Alignment); and then I'll move onto the complexities of symbols / nested symbols.


## Getting started

**Warning: Please use the Beta version at your own risk. I don't want be responsible for possibly 'ruining' your very important Sketch document ðŸ˜œ**

This will be installed separately to 'Paddy', called 'Paddy2'; eventually I'll make it the same thing once it is ready.

**Testing:**
* **Disable Paddy 1:** Make sure 'Paddy' isn't enabled
* **Disable Anima Toolkit:** Make sure 'Anima Toolkit' is not enabled; right now for some reason, they don't seem to play nice together â€” in some cases :/
* **Restart sketch:** this is very important. Every time you re-enable 'Paddy 2', if it's not working, try restarting Sketch.
* **Re-enable all plugins:** If there is nothing above does not help, so disable all plugins, restart sketch and enjoy!

ðŸ™Œ **Bugs:** Please report any issues that you find. Keep in mind, not everything has been implemented yet; see the 'Todo list' below. So only report on stuff not working if it has a 'tick' already against it.

ðŸ’¡ **Feature requests:** Got any other ideas you want to be on Paddy's roadmap; please submit them as an 'Issue', and I'll add them to this list.



## Key differences

Compared to 'Paddy 1' there are a few key differences that have been built so far:

* Setting the properties via the layer name is optional â€“ you can now set them via the inspector panel too.
* A lot faster. In my couple of tests I benchmarked; this came out at being around 30x faster; and in some cases as much as 200x faster!!
* This approach will allow for 'Nested symbols'. Although, it's not currently enabled in the beta, it is something I think I've managed to crack



## When will is come out of beta?

Once I can pretty much get feature parity with Paddy 1, and I know what I have implemented is stable, I will release it. With the plan of fast follow-on release for features like nested symbols.

I will not aim to get everything in the following Todo list complete before shipping; some are stretch goals.


## Todo list

### Automatic re-layout
