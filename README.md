# Paddy 2 â€“ Beta

I've began completely rewriting the [Paddy Sketch plugin](https://github.com/DWilliames/paddy-sketch-plugin) in a way that means I can do a lot more with it.

I have a lot planned for what I want to do with this next version; one of the key things is to make it a lot more stable.

Treat this as the **'Beta program'** for Paddy. If you are up for it; play around with it, and let me know what is working and what isn't.

As you can see via the 'Todo list', not everything has been implemented yet â€“ so bare with me, as I slowly implement it all. I'm trying to lock down the core things now (Padding / Spacing / Alignment); and then I'll move onto the complexities of symbols / nested symbols.


## Getting started

**Warning: Please use the Beta version at your own risk. I don't want be responsible for possibly 'ruining' your very important Sketch document ðŸ˜œ**

This will be installed separately to 'Paddy', called 'Paddy2'; eventually I'll make it the same thing once it is ready.

**Testing:**
* **Disable Paddy 1:** Make sure 'Paddy' isn't enabled
* **Disable Anima Toolkit:** Make sure 'Anima Toolkit' is not enabled; right now for some reason, they don't seem to play nice together â€” in some cases :/
* **Restart sketch:** this is very important. Every time you re-enable 'Paddy 2', if it's not working, try restarting Sketch.

ðŸ™Œ **Bugs:** Please report any issues that you find. Keep in mind, not everything has been implemented yet; see the 'Todo list' below. So only report on stuff not working if it has a 'tick' already against it.

ðŸ’¡ **Feature requests:** Got any other ideas you want to be on Paddy's roadmap; please submit them as an 'Issue', and I'll add them to this list.



## Key differences

Compared to 'Paddy 1' there are a few key differences that have been built so far:

* Setting the properties via the layer name is optional â€“ you can now set them via the inspector panel too.
* A lot faster. In my couple of tests I benchmarked; this came out at being around 30x faster; and in some cases as much as 200x faster!!
* This approach will allow for 'Nested symbols'. Although, it's not currently enabled in the beta, it is something I think I've managed to crack



## When will is come out of beta?

Once I can pretty much get feature parity with Paddy 1, and I know what I have implemented is stable, I will release it. With the plan of fast follow-on release for features like nested symbols.

I will not aim to get everything in the following Todo list complete before shipping; some are stretch goals.


## Todo list

### Automatic re-layout

- [x] Re-layout ancestors after moving a layer
- [x] Re-layout ancestors and children after re-sizing a group
- [x] Re-layout ancestors after changing Text layer value
- [x] Re-layout layers after changing symbol overrides
- [x] Don't re-layout after selection changes from 'un-doing' (e.g. CMD + Z)
- [x] Re-layout after deselecting everything; as a 'catch-all' if it hasn't already been layed out
- [ ] Make sure 'Moving' a layer works with AnimaToolkit installed
- [x] Update after a 'un-grouping' a group
- [x] Make sure using keyboard shortcut to move a layer in the layer list (e.g to back) works. At the moment, it thinks the layer was deleted

---

### Spacing / Stacking

- [x] Read properties from layer name
- [x] Save Stack properties to the layer â€“ so it doesn't *have* to be read from the layer name
- [x] Vertical Stacking
- [x] Horizontal Stacking

- [x] Pixel fit the spacing â€“ based on the user's preferences
- [ ] STRETCH: Allow multiple spacing values â€“ e.g. (10 20) would alternate spacing 10 and 20 pixels
- [ ] STRETCH: After resizing a Stack group, resize the children to respect the new size, and the spacing. This is a really tricky one! But would be a huge time saver!!!
- [ ] After resizing a group to infer new size, make sure that it does not infer a new size on Symbol Instances
#### User interface
- [x] Show a view in the inspector when eligible to create a stack group
- [x] Show UI in the inspector to manipulate the stack vie properties
- [x] Show option to 'remove' the stack group from within the inspector
- [x] Change the icon of the 'Stack group' in the layer list to make it stand out
- [ ] Update the 'Stack group' icon, to something better
- [x] Re-layout the layers after changing the spacing/orientation from within the inspector UI
- [ ] Better placement within the inspector?

---

### Alignment

- [x] Read properties from layer name
- [x] Save alignment properties to layer data â€“ so it doesn't *have* to be read from the layer name

#### User interface
- [x] Show an 'Alignments' view within the inspector for all groups
- [x] Allow only one vertical alignment, and one horizontal alignment from within the UI
- [x] Re-layout the layers as soon as the alignment value is changed from the Inspector
- [ ] Custom icon for each 'alignment group' within the layer list
- [x] Handle setting Alignment to more than one group at once
- [x] Hide vertical/horizontal alignment, based on if the group is stacked; and which direction it is stacked
- [ ] Better placement within the inspector?

---

### Padding

- [x] Read padding from layer name
- [x] Save padding to layer data â€“ so it doesn't *have* to be read from the layer name

- [x] Ignore layers beginning with '-'
- [ ] Allow multiple layers to have padding
- [x] Symbol instances as 'background' layer
- [ ] STRETCH: Adjust sibling layers to match the correct size after resizing the padding layer directly!! (This is a big one! Tricky to do; but a real new timesaver.)
- [ ] Re-layout layer after inserting a layer
#### User interface
- [x] Show padding values within the inspector
- [ ] Show a custom icon for a 'background' layer with padding within the layer list
- [x] Re-layout the layers after changing the padding properties from within the Inspector
